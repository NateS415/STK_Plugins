# STK AER Splitter

The STK AER Splitter is a tool designed to enhance the readability and navigation of AER (Access, Event, and Report) files generated by STK (Systems Toolkit) for multiple satellites within a scenario. It simplifies the process of extracting individual satellite data from a large AER report.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the STK AER Splitter is to split a single AER file, which contains data for all satellites in a scenario, into separate files for each satellite. By doing so, it improves the ease of reading and navigating through the generated AER report.

## Usage

To use the STK AER Splitter, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the AER file generated by STK for your scenario.

2. Execute the STK AER Splitter program, providing the path to the AER file as input.

3. The program will process the AER file and create separate files for each satellite, containing their respective data.

4. Navigate to the directory where the program is executed to find the generated satellite-specific AER files.

5. Open the individual AER files to view and analyze the data for each satellite separately.

## Benefits

Using the STK AER Splitter offers the following benefits:

- Improved readability: By having separate AER files for each satellite, it becomes easier to comprehend and analyze the data, as you can focus solely on the specific satellite of interest.

- Enhanced navigation: Instead of searching through a large AER report containing data for multiple satellites, the splitter provides individual files, allowing for more efficient navigation and data extraction.

- Simplified analysis: The separated AER files enable a more streamlined analysis process, as you can directly access the data you need without dealing with extraneous information.

## Compatibility

The STK AER Splitter is compatible with AER files generated by STK, regardless of the version or scenario configuration.
